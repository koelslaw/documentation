### Rail and Server Installation
Identifying the rail kit contents
To install the left rail:
1. Fully extend the rear sliding bracket of the rail so that the rail
is as long as possible.
2. Position the rail end piece labeled FRONT facing inward and
orient the rear end piece to align with the holes on the rear
rack flanges.
3. Push the rail straight toward the rear of the rack until the
latch locks into place.
4. For the front end piece, rotate the latch outward and pull the
rail forward until the pins slide into the flange, and release the
latch to secure the rail in place.
5. Repeat the preceding steps to install the right rail.
6. Pull the inner rails out of the rack until they lock into place.
7. Locate the rear rail standoff on each side of the system and
lower them into the rear J-slots on the slide assemblies.
8. Install the system and ensure that the rail standoffs are seated
in the J-slots.
9. Push the system inward until the lock levers click into place.
10. Pull the blue slide release lock tabs forward on both rails and
slide the system into the rack until the system is in the rack.
11. To secure the system, push the system into the rack until the
slam latches engage and lock into the rack.

NOTE: To secure the system for shipment in the rack or
in other unstable environments, locate the hard mount
captive screw under each latch and tighten each screw
using a Phillips #2 screwdriver.

12. Release the system from the rack by lifting the slam latches
and sliding the system out of the rack.

NOTE: If applicable, use a Phillips #2 screwdriver to
unscrew the captive screws that secure the system to
the rack.To secure the rails to a square hole or unthreaded round
hole rack for shipping or in unstable environments, install the
supplied screws to the rails.

NOTE: For square hole racks, install the supplied conical washer
to the screw before installing the screw.

NOTE: For unthreaded round hole racks, install only the screw
without the conical washer.

13. Align the screws with the designated U spaces on the front
and rear rack flanges.

NOTE: Ensure that the screw holes on the tab of the
system retention bracket are seated on the designated
U spaces.

14. Insert and tighten the two screws using the Phillips #2
screwdriver to secure the rails to the rack.
