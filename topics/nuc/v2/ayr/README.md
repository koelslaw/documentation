# Alternate Yum Repository
Used to create a local mirror for redistribution on a local network. If you live in the sticks like I do, bandwidth is precious so reaching out repeatedly to get the same stuff sucks. I have forked the orginal and simplfied it a little. The big difference is that you will have to regester your RHEL stuff prior to firing things off instead of adding creds to the script. I don't like keeping my RHEL creds in a clear text file. This also makes it easier to deploy on centos.

## Prep Work
- Update things ` sudo yum update`
- add the epel repo
`sudo yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm`
- then install the ansible and git `sudo yum install ansible git`
- Clone this playbook
- Add the repos you with to have loaded on you system like:
  - EPEL (should have this if you installed ansible already)
  `sudo yum install epel-release`
  - Custom Yum Repository Like "ROCK NSM"
  `sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/rocknsm/rocknsm-2.1/repo/epel-7/group_rocknsm-rocknsm-2.1-epel-7.repo`

:warning:This a bandwidth intensive operation, grab a cup of coffee or go to lunch. This will take a while! Disable or move any repos that you do not  :warning:

One you have repos that you wish to have replicated across you LAN then you fire off the ansible script with `sudo ansible-playbook -vvvv site.yml -i hosts.ini`

> Note I run this verbose because this usually takes a while and I want to make sure that nothing has died.

## Repo synchronization

Regular syncs of the repo are required in order to keep it up to date.
You can trigger just the repo sync manually, executing the playbook with
--tags sync_mirror

Also you can setup a cronjob that will automatically trigger the repository
synchronization on the schedule you decide. To enable it, you need to set the
``repo_autosync`` var to True. To define the schedule for the cronjob,
the following vars can be set:
* crontab_day
* crontab_hour
* crontab_minute
* crontab_month
* crontab_weekday

When setting ``repo_autosync`` var to False, the cronjob will be removed.
In order to just setup the cronjob, you can execute the playbook with the
``prepare_cron`` tag.
